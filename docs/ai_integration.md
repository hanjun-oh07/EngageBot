# AI Integration

## Overview

EngageBot uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model through LangChain to generate natural and context-aware responses. The AI integration is designed to provide personalized and engaging conversations while maintaining appropriate language levels and cultural sensitivity.

## Components

### 1. LangChain Integration

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser

# Initialize the chain
llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4", temperature=0.7)
output_parser = StrOutputParser()
```

### 2. Prompt Engineering

#### System Prompts
```python
system_prompt = f"""You are a friendly student who is similar to the user:
- Age: {user_profile['age']}
- Language Level: {user_profile['language_level']}

Your role is to:
1. Act like a student of similar age and language level
2. Keep the conversation engaging and natural
3. Ask follow-up questions to encourage discussion
4. Provide gentle corrections if needed
5. Be supportive and encouraging
6. Add suitable emojis that match the tone of the chat."""
```

#### Conversation Prompts
```python
conversation_prompt = f"""Previous conversation: {messages[-4:]}
User's response: {user_input}
Please respond naturally and continue the conversation in a way that would be natural for students of similar age and language level."""
```

### 3. Context Management

#### User Profile Integration
```python
user_context = {
    "age": user_profile["age"],
    "nationality": user_profile["nationality"],
    "language_level": user_profile["language_level"]
}
```

#### Conversation History
```python
conversation_context = {
    "previous_messages": messages[-4:],
    "current_topic": selected_topic,
    "scenario": current_scenario
}
```

## Response Generation Process

1. **Input Processing**
   - User message received
   - Context gathered
   - Profile information loaded

2. **Prompt Construction**
   - System prompt created
   - Conversation history added
   - User input incorporated

3. **Response Generation**
   - LangChain chain invoked
   - GPT-4 generates response
   - Output parsed and formatted

4. **Response Post-Processing**
   - Emojis added
   - Language level checked
   - Cultural appropriateness verified

## Customization Options

### 1. Temperature Settings
```python
# More creative responses
creative_llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4", temperature=0.9)

# More focused responses
focused_llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4", temperature=0.3)
```

### 2. Response Length
```python
# Control response length through prompt
length_prompt = f"""Please keep your response under {max_length} words.
{original_prompt}"""
```

### 3. Style Adaptation
```python
# Adjust style based on scenario
style_prompt = f"""Respond in a {style} manner:
{original_prompt}"""
```

## Error Handling

### 1. API Errors
```python
try:
    response = chain.invoke(context)
except Exception as e:
    # Handle API errors
    error_message = "I'm having trouble generating a response. Please try again."
    return error_message
```

### 2. Context Errors
```python
if not context.get("user_profile"):
    # Handle missing profile
    return "Please log in to continue the conversation."
```

### 3. Response Validation
```python
def validate_response(response):
    # Check for inappropriate content
    # Verify language level
    # Ensure cultural sensitivity
    return validated_response
```

## Best Practices

1. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Keep prompts clear and concise
   - Include relevant context
   - Specify desired response format

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement graceful fallbacks
   - Provide user-friendly error messages
   - Log errors for debugging

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Cache frequently used responses
   - Minimize context size
   - Use appropriate temperature settings

4. **Security**
   - Validate user input
   - Sanitize responses
   - Protect sensitive information

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Response Quality**
   - Monitor conversation flow
   - Track user satisfaction
   - Adjust prompts as needed

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Response time
   - Error rates
   - User engagement

3. **Regular Updates**
   - Update prompts
   - Refine context handling
   - Optimize performance
